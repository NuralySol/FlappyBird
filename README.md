# FlappyBird

## This is a FlappyBird Project 

* I have all of the theory and the project concepts in place.
* Pseudo code/code is not ready yet but will be doing over the weekend and will have a prototype by the end of the weekeend.
* Want to add a lot of extra features for more aesthetitc and fun experience for the user.
* User story is an important aspect of the project.

## Sprites? or Canvas?

> **TO DO**: The most important choice over the weekend to choose the graphical display of the game. Canvas is easier but custom sprites might add more character and uniqness to the project. 

## The behavior and the gravity for user experience.

> The theoretical behovior and the physics of the bird and the randomness is known the source of that is a paper by CS class at Columbia engineering. **reference:** [CSEngineeringColumbia](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/4840/reports/Flappy-Bird.pdf)
